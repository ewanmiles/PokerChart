        question: "What does PokerChart do?",
        answer: "PokerChart is an app that allows you to track your poker games, hopefully helping you examine how you play. By adding losses or gains after each hand in your game, you will be able to chart your stack size and average stack change over the game. This can help you learn about your play structure. It also gives top stats such as your pot win percentage and your best takes for the game."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I start a game?",
        answer: "You can start a game by simply logging into the app and clicking the 'Start Game' button under Solo, or the 'Join Game' or 'Create Game' buttons under Group. This will take you to a screen where you add your buy-in and currency for the game, and give it a name. Once you have played the hands, and want to end the game, you can simply click either the 'End Game' button at the bottom of a solo game, or the 'Leave Game' button at the bottom of a group game."
    },
    {
        question: "What do I do once I've started a game?",
        answer: "This is the bit where you do the work! If you keep track of what you lose or win at the end of each hand, you can press the 'Loss' or 'Gain' button on the game screen, and an input box will appear. Put in what you lost or gained in the hand and click submit - this will update the graphs in real time, so you can see, as you play, how your game is going! That's all you need to do, PokerChart can take care of the rest."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I play a game with a group?",
        answer: "You certainly can! If you click 'Create Game' under Group on the home page (the one titled 'Game History'), you can name the room and give it a password. Here you set details like the buy-in and the currency. After that, an ID code (room key) will appear at the top and you can give this to your friends, along with your password, and they can join the room! When you submit losses and gains, you will also be able to see other players' stack sizes and stack changes over the game."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I have to add other players' stats in a group game?",
        answer: "Not at all. If you have told your friends the room key and the password, they will appear in the 'Players' box at the top of the game screen. Then, when they finish their hand, they can use PokerChart just as you do. Once they submit a loss or gain, their data will show up on your charts automatically!"
    },
    {
        question: "What if I don't lose OR gain money in a hand, and there is a split pot?",
        answer: "If you take back exactly what you put in to a hand (which is rare), simply click 'Loss' OR 'Gain' and put in 0. That way, the graph will register no change in your stack for that hand."
    },
    {
        question: "Does it save the stats from my old games?",
        answer: "It does! The home page, titled 'Game History', is the page you are taken to when you log in. Once you have played games, you click the 'End Game' or 'Leave Game' button to save it to your history. Then it will appear once you go back to the home page where your history is listed! This will not disappear unless you delete either the game, or your account."
    },
    {
        question: "What can I do to my games in my Game History?",
        answer: "You can look at the stats of your play in the chosen game, and look at how you may have played well, or badly. You can also rename the game, by clicking the pencil icon next to its name. The 'Delete {game name}' button at the bottom will delete the game from your history. Be warned - if you delete it, you can't get it back, ever!"
    },
    {
        question: "What can I do to my account?",
        answer: "When you create an account, you get an account page where you can look at stats from across all of your games, including your total pot win percentage, your biggest win and your longest game. You can change your name by clicking the pencil icon. That's all that's possible for the moment, apart from deleting your account! This is available just above the log out button at the bottom of the home page, but you will be required to put in your password to delete your account."
